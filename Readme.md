### Wellcome
Hello!

My name is Stefan, I am 25 years old and I am a programmer and graduate of the full stack developer course held at the Software Development Academy, which took place over a period of 9 months during which I studied mostly Java, Spring and My SQL but also HTML, CSS and Angular. For more details you can visit my LinkedIn account whose link you will find below.

### Description
I started working on this application out of the desire to create a web application, an online shop like eMag or Altex. Of course, these are great applications that many talented developers are working on, but as a benchmark they have been used.

The application is structured like any Spring Boot application (whose structure can be downloaded by accessing the link above) that was written using InteliJ. Having the Model Class that contains Pojo Classes. The Repository class that extends the PagingAndSortingRepository Interface that integrates the CRUD Interface but also includes the paging part. The Repository class that connects to the Front End and the Controller Class that includes business logic.

To use a database I used the MySQL application and to populate it I used the Faker Class.

To test all the APIs created I used Postma. Which was also used for the popular part of the database.

To make everything possible and to post the project repository on the Git Hub platform I had to use the Git application which is a version control system and is different from Git Hub.

### Future Improvements
I am aware that the application is in its infancy, without a frontend part, but to show what I can do I created this little project that will be improved in the future.
